# 5. Azure Spatial Anchors for Android and iOS

In this tutorial, you will learn how to build your project to Android and iOS devices using AR Foundation, ARCore XR Plugin, and ARKit XR Plugin.

## Objectives

* Learn how to build your project to your Android device using Unity's AR Foundation and ARCore XR Plugin
* Learn how to build your project to your iOS device using Unity's AR Foundation and ARKit XR Plugin

## Installing inbuilt Unity packages

[!INCLUDE[](includes/installing-inbuilt-unity-packages-for-asa-android-and-ios)]

## Configure MRTK for AR Foundation Camera

In this section, you will learn how to configure MRTK for deploying to a mobile device.

In the Hierarchy window, select the **MixedRealityToolkit** object. Then in the Inspector window, select the **Camera** tab, clone the camera profile, and give it a suitable name, for example, **AzureSpatialAnchors_ARCameraProfile**:

> [!TIP]
> For a reminder on how to clone MRTK profiles, you can refer to the [Configuring the Mixed Reality Toolkit profiles](mr-learning-base-03.md) instructions.

With the **Camera** tab still selected in the Inspector window, expand the **Camera Setting Providers** and by clicking the "-" remove the **Windows Mixed Reality Camera Setting** or **XR SDK Windows Mixed Reality Camera Setting**:
