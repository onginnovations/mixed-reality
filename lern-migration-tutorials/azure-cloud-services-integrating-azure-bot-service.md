# 9. Integrating Azure Bot Service
## Azure bot service
Azure Bot Service is Microsoft’s artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot offered as a service on the Azure cloud service marketplace.Azure Bot Service offers the ability to add intelligent agents that are capable of conversation without having to commit the resources to develop one’s own AI. The service can be added to websites, apps, email, GroupMe, Facebook Messenger, Kik, Skype, Slack, Microsoft Teams, Telegram, SMS, Twilio, Cortana and Skype for Business.
The platform gives bot developers a software development kit (SDK) and tools to add bots to sites in the form of Azure Bot Builder. Bots made with the Azure Bot Builder are automatically added to Microsoft’s directory. Azure Bot services also supports bots coded in Python, Java, Javascript and #C.
## Bot framework composer
Bot Framework Composer, built on the Bot Framework SDK, is an open-source IDE for developers to author, test, provision and manage conversational experiences. It provides a powerful visual authoring canvas enabling dialogs, language-understanding models, QnAMaker knowledgebases and language generation responses to be authored from within one canvas and crucially, enables these experiences to be extended with code for more complex tasks such as system integration. Resulting experiences can then be tested within Composer and provisioned into Azure along with any dependent resources.
Composer is available as a desktop application for Windows, OSX and Linux as well as a web-based component which can be customized and extended to suit your needs.Authoring dialog experiences with a visual designer is more efficient and enables easier modeling of more sophisticated conversational experiences where context switching, interruption and more natural and dynamic conversation flows are important. More complex activities such as integrating with dependencies such as REST Web Services are best suited towards code and we provide an easy mechanism to extend Composer bots with code bringing the best of both together.
## Azure function
Azure Functions is a cloud service available on-demand that provides all the continually updated infrastructure and resources needed to run your applications. You focus on the pieces of code that matter most to you, and Functions handles the rest. Functions provides serverless compute for Azure. You can use Functions to build web APIs, respond to database changes, process IoT streams, manage message queues, and more.
## LUIS
Language Understanding (LUIS) is a cloud-based conversational AI service that applies custom machine-learning intelligence to a user's conversational, natural language text to predict overall meaning, and pull out relevant, detailed information. LUIS provides access through its custom portal, APIs and SDK client libraries.
## Http GET calls
The HTTP GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only be used to request data (they shouldn't include data).
