# Exercise: User Interface and interaction models

There are several ways of providing inputs and manipulating objects on the scene. Inputs are given to trigger certain events and perform some changes. Adding Bounds Control around 3D objects makes it easier to control the object manipulation.

## Creating a static panel of buttons

1. In the Hierarchy window, right-click on the **RoverExplorer** object and select **Create Empty** to add an empty object as a child of the RoverExplorer, name the object **Buttons**, and configure the **Transform** component as follows:
    * **Position**: X = -0.6, Y = 0.036, Z = -0.5
    * **Rotation**: X = 90, Y = 0, Z = 0
    * **Scale**: X = 1, Y = 1, Z = 1
