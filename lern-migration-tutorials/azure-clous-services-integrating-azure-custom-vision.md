# 5. Integrating Azure Custom Vision
## Azure custom vision
Azure Custom Vision is an image recognition service that lets you build, deploy, and improve your own image identifiers. An image identifier applies labels (which represent classes or objects) to images, according to their visual characteristics. Unlike the Computer Vision service, Custom Vision allows you to specify the labels and train custom models to detect them.
## Cognitive services
Cognitive Services are a set of machine learning algorithms that Microsoft has developed to solve problems in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The goal of Cognitive Services is to democratize AI by packaging it into discrete components that are easy for developers to use in their own apps. Web and Universal Windows Platform developers can consume these algorithms through standard REST calls over the Internet to the Cognitive Services APIs.
