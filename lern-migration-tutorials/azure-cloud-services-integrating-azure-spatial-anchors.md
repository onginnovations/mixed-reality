# 7. Integrating Azure Spatial Anchors
## Azure spatial anchors
With a local real-world environment mapped out, we can identify a single point within the 3D space to be used as a reference point.These points are called a number of things including “Reference Points” and “AR Anchors” … but recently the industry seems to have settled on naming them “Spatial Anchors”.Usually, the 3D point cloud exists only locally and for the lifecycle of the application.In order for a mobile device to recognise the same physical location at a later point in time, the point-cloud needs to be persisted to storage.For a self-contained application, this could be local device storage - but if we want multiple users, with multiple devices, to share and collaborate in the same physical space, the point-cloud needs to be persisted in a cloud-storage service, which then lets us share this data between devices.

It is this role that Microsoft’s Azure Spatial Anchors (ASA) fulfils.ASA is a cloud-based service supplied with application-specific SDKs. It is a relatively new service, first announced in February 2019.At the time of writing, we have an SDK for use with the Unity game engine.
