### 4. Create a Holographic Remoting PC Application

The Holographic Remoting Player is a companion programme that links to Holographic Remoting-compatible PC apps and games. Holographic Remoting uses a Wi-Fi connection to transmit holographic content from a PC to your Microsoft HoloLens in real time.

Only PC apps that are intended to support Holographic Remoting can be utilised with the Holographic Remoting Player.

## Internet Client Server Capabilities 
The Network Client server manager can be used to manage connections in many multiuser applications, but you can alternatively utilise the lower-level NetworkServer and NetworkClient classes directly.
Every application that uses the High-Level API must connect to a host server. In a multiuser application, each user can act as a client, a dedicated server, or a server and client at the same time.

## Open XR
OpenXR is an open standard for creating high-performance VR apps that can run on a variety of systems. OpenXR seeks to make VR creation easier by allowing developers to use the same code across several platforms.

## Depth 16
In unity ,the precision of the render texture's depth buffer in bits (0, 16, 24/32 are supported).
16 means at least 16 bit Z buffer and no stencil buffer

## Eye Gaze Interaction
The Eye Tracking Interaction extension provided by Khronos is supported by Unity OpenXR. To get the posture data that the extension returns, use this layout.

This device is currently unavailable in the Unity Input System drop-down options. To bind, go to the gaze position/rotation and utilise the binding paths listed below.
Position	<EyeGaze>/pose/position
Rotation	<EyeGaze>/pose/rotation

## Microsoft Hand Interaction 
The Hololens 2 Hand interaction profile is supported by Unity OpenXR. Bindings that use XR Controller and are available on this device (for example, XRController>/devicePosition) will bind appropriately because this layout inherits from XRController>.

Hand mesh or hand rig data are not included in this interaction profile. These will be added at a later date.
