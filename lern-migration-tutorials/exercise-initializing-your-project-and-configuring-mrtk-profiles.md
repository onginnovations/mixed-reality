# Exercise: Initializing your project and configuring MRTK profiles

In this exercise, you'll learn how to create a new Unity project, configure it for Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) development, and import MRTK. You'll also walk through configuring, building, and deploying a basic Unity scene from Visual Studio to your HoloLens 2. Once you have deployed it to your HoloLens 2, you should see a spatial mapping mesh covering the surfaces that are perceived by the HoloLens. Additionally, you should see indicators on your hands and fingers for hand tracking and a frame rate counter for keeping an eye on app performance.

## Creating the Unity project

1. Launch **Unity Hub**, select the **Projects** tab, and click the **down arrow** next to the **New** button:
