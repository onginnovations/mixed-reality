#  Azure Speech Services Tutorials



We will create a Mixed Reality application that explores the use of Azure Speech Services with the HoloLens 2. When we complete this module series, we will be able to use your device's microphone to transcribe speech to text in real time, translate our speech into other languages, and leverage the Intent recognition feature to understand voice commands using artificial intelligence.
