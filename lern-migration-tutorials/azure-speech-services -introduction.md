#  Azure Speech Services Tutorials



We will create a Mixed Reality application that explores the use of Azure Speech Services with the HoloLens 2. When we complete this module series, we will be able to use your device's microphone to transcribe speech to text in real time, translate our speech into other languages, and leverage the Intent recognition feature to understand voice commands using artificial intelligence.

## Learning Objectives

* Learn how to integrate Azure Speech Services with a HoloLens 2 application
* Learn how to use speech recognition to transcribe text
* Learn how Azure speech recognition can be used to execute commands
* Learn how to integrate Azure speech translation
* Learn how to set up intent, entities, and utterances in the LUIS portal
* Learn how to implement intent and natural language understanding in our application

## Prerequisites
