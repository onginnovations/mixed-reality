## 3. Saving, retrieving, and sharing Azure Spatial Anchors

Azure Spatial Anchors enable you to share anchors in the world across many devices. It works with a variety of development environments.We can share the Azure Anchor ID between multiple devices.

## Interactable script 

Any item can be made interactable with a distinguished visual state using the Interactable script.For example, you can alter the colour of the object when it is in focus or enlarge it when it is pressed. You can achieve intricate visual states, including shader property changes, because you can have many themes that control distinct aspects of the object.External components, such as PhysicalPressEventRouter, can be used to augment interactable features by allowing press events to drive state changes in the interactable.
