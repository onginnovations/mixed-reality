## 5. Displaying feedback from Azure Spatial Anchors

 Azure Spatial Anchors gives developers the tools they need to create spatially aware mixed reality apps. Users can give  feedback on anchor discovery, events, and status (ASA).It's a tool for storing and retrieving spatial-point-cloud data.This action can be seen based on Users feedback through a UI panel that displays essential information about the current ASA session.


## Scene Visibility 

You may rapidly hide and expose GameObjects in the Scene view using Unity's Scene visibility controls without affecting their visibility in-game.This is important when working with large or complex Scenes where viewing and selecting specific GameObjects can be difficult.Because visibility options only affect the Scene view, using them is safer than deactivating GameObjects. This means you won't be able to mistakenly delete GameObjects from the rendered scene or start superfluous bake processes for lighting, occlusion, or other systems.
