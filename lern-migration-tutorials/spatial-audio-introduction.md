# Spatial Audio Tutorials

 Through this module series, you will learn how to use head-related transfer function (HRTF) offload on HoloLens 2 and How to enable reverb when using HRTF offload.

## Learning Objectives
* Importing and Enabling Microsoft spatializer plugin
* Enabling Spatial audio on your developer workstation
* Add and Spatialize the button click sounds
* Import a video and add a Video Player
* Play the video onto a quadrangle
* Route audio from the video to the quadrangle, and spatialize the audio
* Add a new script to control spatialization on a game object
* Drive the spatialization control script from button actions
* Improve perceived distance of sound sources by adding reverb.
* Control perceived distance of the sound using the listener's distance to the hologram.
## Prerequisites
* A Windows 10 PC configured with the correct tools installed
* Basic c# programming knowledge
* A HoloLens 2 device configured for development
* Unity Hub with Unity 2020/2019 LTS mounted, and the Universal Windows Platform Build Support module added
