# 1. Introduction to the MRTK tutorials

How exciting would it be to construct your hologram and let them behave the way you want to? Constructing holograms from scratch is a time-consuming and tedious task, especially if you have numerous holograms on the scene.

In the course of the tutorials, you will be able to understand features of the Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) and build a mixed reality user experience by using NASA's Mars Curiosity Rover hologram model.

Before the end, you will be effectively able to speed up your development process by having a firm grip on MRTK.

## Learning Objectives

* Initialize your project and first application for mixed reality development
* Configure Mixed Reality Toolkit profiles
* Position objects on the scene
* Add interactables to the 3D Objects
* Use eye tracking to manipulate objects
* Operate objects on the scene using voice commands

## Prerequisites

* A Windows 10 PC configured with the correct tools installed
* Windows 10 SDK 10.0.18362.0 or later
* A HoloLens 2 device configured for development
* Unity Hub with Unity 2019 LTS (currently 2019.4.x) installed and the Universal Windows
  Platform Build Support module added

When installing Unity, please make sure to check following components under **'Platforms'**.

* **Universal Windows Platform Build Support**
* **Windows Build Support (IL2CPP)**

If you installed Unity without these options, you can add them through **'Add Modules'** menu in Unity Hub.
